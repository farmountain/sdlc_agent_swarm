    notes: |
      This workflow respects OpenSpec as the primary source of truth.
      SDLC swarm supplements OpenSpec with:
      - Verification (evidence-gated validation)
      - Test generation (from scenarios)
      - Implementation (autonomous coding)
      - Architecture diagrams (supplementing design.md)
      
      Does NOT duplicate:
      - PRD (uses OpenSpec proposal.md)
      - Requirements (uses OpenSpec specs/)
      - Design (uses OpenSpec design.md)
      - Task breakdown (uses OpenSpec tasks.md)
