# First 30 Days Adoption Plan

## Week 1
- Use SDLC Swarm only for PRDs
- No release gating
- Observe evidence quality

## Week 2
- Add Architecture Review
- Introduce NFRs (performance, security)
- Still no hard blocks

## Week 3
- Enable Release Readiness for HIGH-risk only
- Start using dashboards

## Week 4
- Evaluate outcomes
- Decide where governance is helpful
- Adjust risk thresholds

## Rule
Never turn everything to HIGH governance.
That kills adoption.
