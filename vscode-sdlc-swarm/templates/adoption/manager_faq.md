# Manager FAQ

## Q: Does this slow teams down?
A: No.
LOW-risk changes move faster.
HIGH-risk changes slow down on purpose.

## Q: Is this replacing approvals?
A: No.
It makes approvals informed, not blind.

## Q: Can teams bypass it?
A: Yes — but bypasses are visible and explicit.

## Q: How do I know if a release is safe?
A: Look at:
- Risk score
- Evidence completeness
- Verifier status
- Dashboard snapshot

You no longer rely on "it should be fine".
