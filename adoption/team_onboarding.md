# Team Onboarding (Engineers)

## Start here (10 minutes)
1. Install the SDLC Swarm extension
2. Open your repo
3. Run: "SDLC: Plan to PRD"
4. Read the SPEC and TEST cards it generates

## What changes for you
- LOW risk work → almost no friction
- HIGH risk work → clearer expectations
- Arguments shift from opinion → evidence

## What does NOT change
- You still design
- You still code
- You still decide (with approval when needed)

## Golden rule
If the system blocks you, it must explain WHY.
If it cannot explain, it is wrong.
