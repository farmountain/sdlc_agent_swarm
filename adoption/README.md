# SDLC Swarm — How to Adopt Without Slowing Down

## What this is
A no-code, evidence-gated SDLC assistant inside VS Code.

## What this is NOT
- Not a replacement for engineers
- Not a replacement for architects
- Not an auto-approval system
- Not surveillance

## Why teams use it
- Fewer late-stage surprises
- Clear decisions with evidence
- Faster LOW-risk changes
- Safer HIGH-risk releases

## The core idea
You already do SDLC.
This system makes it explicit, auditable, and safer.
