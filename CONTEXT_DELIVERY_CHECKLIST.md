## What You Should Do Now

### Option 1: Review (Recommended)

Read through:
1. README.md (5 min)
2. PLANNING.md (10 min)
3. Any topic from Navigation Map that interests you

### Option 2: Start Week 1

Say: `Start Week 1`

I'll generate complete Foundation OS package (no back-and-forth).

### Option 3: Add More Context

If you have additional requirements or context, share now.
